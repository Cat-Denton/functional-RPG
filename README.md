Planning:

Sci-fi, Cyberpunk-style

Player generated character
properties:
name
level (we can use this to modify strength of randomly generated badguys)
stats bar:
  * Strength
  * Body
  * Mind
  * Speed
  * Cyber
  * Hit Points

equipment (maybe modifies stats?)

randomly generated bad guys
stats
  * damage
  * hit points

have the character and bad guy fight

character does damage -> reduces bad guy hit points

bad guy does damage -> reduces character current hit points

whoever reaches zero first dies
